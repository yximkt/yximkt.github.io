Preliminary Research Waiting for Feedbacks <br>

**<ins>Abstract:</ins>** Existing psychological literature in prosocial domain suggests previous moral behavior sometimes leads people to do more of the same, while sometimes it liberates people to do the opposite in lab settings. We reconcile this debate by providing different types of prior information and conducting a large-scale field experiment on charitable crowdfunding. The real-world study finds the existence of both effects similar to consistency-seeking and licensing phenomena, with frequency VS. amount information of prior moral behavior being primed respectively. Further mechanism analysis suggests that such prior moral information works as a decent peripheral cue for opt-put donators, accelerating their decision processes of not donating. Given the large heterogeneity of the population, we finally develop a personalized targeting policy that allocates the optimal treatment to each potential donator and show that it leads to sizable improvement in donation ratio with the status-qua policy. Our results shed lights on both psychological mechanisms in charitable research and managerial practice for such crowdfunding platforms.

**<ins>Abstract:</ins>** We examine donation behaviors from the perspective of religious beliefs. Using a transaction-level dataset from an Asian economy, we find that individuals with higher income uncertainty are more likely to donate, especially for religious donations, and after negative income uncertainty and health shocks. This pattern is inconsistent with existing explanations of donation, but can be explained by a “spiritual insurance” channel, which posits that giving reduces the probability of the bad state. Indeed, we observe that those who donate to non-local religious organizations reduce their insurance purchases. We additionally conduct a field experiment on 4 million donors in the online donation platform Waterdrop, and find the spiritual insurance narrative significantly increases the likelihood to donate. We contribute by combining archival data and field experiment for the first time to show that the “spiritual insurance” channel can be influential for donation behaviors and the insurance market.

**<ins>Abstract:</ins>** Short-form video sharing platforms have seen phenomenal growth in recent years. One particular type of video that can often go viral on such platforms is condensed clips derived from existing full-length video content. The traditional entertainment industry has strongly criticized this new form of user-generated derivative content because it may infringe copyright owners' exclusive rights and steal viewers from original works. Little is known, however, regarding the actual impact of condensed clips on the demand for corresponding original works. In this study, we seek to identify such an impact by an exogenous boycott event in April 2021 that forced Chinese TikTok to remove condensed clips more proactively. Results indicated that their removal had reduced the demand for corresponding full-length original works on a major video streaming platform by approximately 3%. In other words, condensed clips serve as friends, rather than foes, of streaming services. Further analyses suggested that the positive spillover effects came from the fact that condensed clips could enhance the visibility of original works, and such spillover effect was stronger if the original work/parts were inherently more attractive (e.g., of higher quality or having a more fascinating storyline). Our results offer rich managerial and policy insights.

**<ins>Intro:</ins>** This paper examines spillover effects of new product launches on existing within-category VS. cross-category products in the green evolution of an industry. We find both within-category spillover and cross-category cannibalization effects during the green evolution of the
automobile industry.
