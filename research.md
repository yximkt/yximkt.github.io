<ins>Abstract:</ins> The widespread availability of digitalized contents and video editing tools has made it possible for ordinary users to generate clips based on existing video works. 
  In this research, we leverage an exogenous boycott event and the quasi-experiment design to estimate causal effects of such derivative works from TikTok on demand of original contents in the context of TV show viewership at streaming platforms. 
  Combing data from both platforms, we find evidence for our identification strategy and estimate that derivative clips on TikTok bring about 3% volume for video streaming platforms. 
  Further mechanism analysis suggests the positive advertising influences come from coexistence of both reminding and informative effects by such user-generated clips, 
  but are limited by the time cost incurred from complete consumption of original TV dramas, though viewers might have already been induced to search them on the streaming platform yet then give up a start due to their extreme length. 
  These empirical findings highlight the advertising effects of derivative works and directly respond to both managerial practice and legal debates in this industry by showing potential benefits of strategically providing ordinary users with certain original contents to edit derivative clips.
