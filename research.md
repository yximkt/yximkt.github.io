**<ins>Abstract:</ins>** Sharing plays a vital role for charities, often seen as a way to leverage one's network capitals. Theoretical evidence suggests that sharing can serve as either a compelling alternative to, or complement for, monetary contributions. We conducted a field experiment to compare the impact of highlighting the donation option versus the sharing option through a behavioral nudge design. The result shows that emphasizing sharing led a measurable substitution of monetary contributions. However, when taking “chain donations” into account, the sharing nudge resulted in  a sizable net increase in total funds raised, highlighting the power of network capitals. Furthermore, we find that there are divergences between motives to respond and effects of responding for people with varied network capitals. People with more within-community (vs. outside-community) friends are more inclined to respond to the nudge. However, the total donation effect increases with the number of outside-community friends but not with within-community friends. Based on these results, we provide targeting insights for fundraisers and the platform.

  <p>Short-form video sharing platforms have seen phenomenal growth in recent years. One particular type of video that can often go viral on such platforms is condensed clips derived from existing full-length video content. The traditional entertainment industry has strongly criticized this new form of user-generated derivative content because it may infringe copyright owners' exclusive rights and steal viewers from original works. Little is known, however, regarding the actual impact of condensed clips on the demand for corresponding original works. In this study, we seek to identify such an impact with the help of an exogenous boycott event in April 2021 that forced Chinese TikTok to remove condensed clips more proactively. Results indicated that their removal had reduced the demand for corresponding full-length original works on a major video streaming platform by approximately 3%. In other words, condensed clips serve as friends, rather than foes, of streaming services. Further analyses suggested that the positive spillover effects resulted from the fact that condensed clips could enhance the visibility of original works, and such spillover effect was stronger if the original work/parts were inherently more attractive and less likely to be replaced (e.g., of higher quality or having a more fascinating storyline). Our results offer rich managerial and policy insights.</p>

  <p>We examine donation behaviors from the perspective of religious beliefs. Using a transaction-level dataset from an Asian economy, we find that individuals with higher income uncertainty are more likely to donate, especially for religious donations, and after negative income uncertainty and health shocks. This pattern is inconsistent with existing explanations of donation, but can be explained by a "spiritual insurance" channel, which posits that giving reduces the probability of the bad state. Indeed, we observe that those who donate to non-local religious organizations reduce their insurance purchases. We additionally analyze a field experiment on 30 million potential donors conducted by a large online donation platform, and find that spiritual insurance narratives significantly increase the likelihood to donate. We contribute by combining archival data and field experiment for the first time to show that the "spiritual insurance" channel can be influential for donation behaviors and the insurance market.</p>

  <summary><strong><ins>Intro:</ins></strong></summary>
  <p>Existing psychological literature in prosocial domain suggests previous moral behavior sometimes leads people to do more of the same, while sometimes it liberates people to do the opposite in lab settings. We reconcile this debate by providing different types of historical donation information and conducting a large-scale field experiment on a major charitable platform. The real-world study involving millions of participants identifies effects similar to both consistency-seeking and licensing phenomena, with different information of prior moral behavior being primed, respectively. We shed lights on both psychological mechanisms in charitable research and managerial practice in platform design.</p>
