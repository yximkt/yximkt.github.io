I would like to describe my way in the coming years as a PhD candidate to behavioral and data scientist interested in consumersâ€™ problems. And the core technical foundations would be applied econometrics and advanced data analysis including unstructured ones. 

The building conceptual framework of my research, which might leverage lab /quasi-experiment setting or observational data, would be behavioral principles.

The research that interests me most leverages data to explore consumers and their behavior under different environmental and marketing stimulus, especially in the digital world. 

Prior to GSM, I studied management at [Central University of Finance and Economics](http://bs.cufe.edu.cn/index.htm).
