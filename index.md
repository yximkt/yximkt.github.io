Welcome! I am Guangxin Yang, currently a Ph.D. candidate in quantitative track at Guanghua School of Management, Peking University. 

My passion lies in becoming a data and behavioral scientist, with specialties in digital marketing. In pursuit of this ambition, I combine rigorous causal inference, machine learning, econometric methods and insights from behavioral science to tackle important questions in the domain of digital platforms.

My recent research centers on charitable contexts through two complementary lenses: incentivizing donors and helping patients craft more effective appeals. Through large-scale field experiments and cutting-edge computational methods (e.g., deep learning, computer vision, etc.), my research explores how behavioral nudges, visual content strategies, and language models can enhance prosocial outcomes on charitable crowdfunding platforms.

My research has been published in Marketing Science and under revision for other top business journals. 

Beyond academia, I have gained valuable managerial experience during my research internship at both [WaterDrop](https://www.waterdrop-inc.com) (2023.1-present) and [iQIYI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQIYI) (2023.6-2023.8). 

I'm fortunate to be advised by Professor [Qiaowei Shen(Chair)](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=qshen) ,  [Yingjie Zhang](https://sites.google.com/view/yingjiezhang/home) and [Hongju Liu](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=hliu) at Guanghua School of Managment. 

I also spent around one and a half years at Marketing Department of [Leonard N. Stern School of Business of New York University](https://www.stern.nyu.edu) as a Visiting Ph.D. Student and was supervised by Professor [Xiao Liu](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/xiao-liu) on deep learning and LLM projects.
