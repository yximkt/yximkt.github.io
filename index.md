Welcome! I am Guangxin Yang, a Ph.D. candidate in the quantitative track at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, advised by Professor [Qiaowei Shen](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=qshen) (Chair),  [Yingjie Zhang](https://sites.google.com/view/yingjiezhang/home) and [Hongju Liu](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=hliu). 

<strong>My passion lies in becoming a data and behavioral scientist, with specialties in digital marketing.</strong> In pursuit of this ambition, I combine rigorous <span class="badge">causal inference</span>, <span class="badge">machine learning</span>, <span class="badge">econometric methods</span> and <strong>insights from behavioral science</strong> to tackle important questions in the domain of <strong>digital platforms</strong>.

<strong>My recent research centers on charitable contexts through incentivizing donors and helping patients craft their appeals.</strong> Through large-scale field experiments and cutting-edge computational methods (e.g., deep learning, computer vision, etc.), my research explores how behavioral nudges, visual strategies, and large language models can enhance prosocial outcomes on charitable crowdfunding platforms.

My research has been published in <cite class="journal">Marketing Science</cite> and is under revision for other top business journals. 

Beyond academia, I have gained valuable managerial experience during my research internship at both [WaterDrop](https://www.waterdrop-inc.com) (2023.1-present) and [iQIYI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQIYI) (2023.6-2023.8). 

I also spent around one and a half years at [Stern School of Business, New York University](https://www.stern.nyu.edu) as a Visiting Ph.D. Student and was supervised by Professor [Xiao Liu](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/xiao-liu) on deep learning and LLM projects.
