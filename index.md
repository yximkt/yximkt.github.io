I would like to describe my way in the coming years as a PhD candidate to a data and behavioral scientist interested in consumersâ€™ problems.

The building conceptual framework of my research would be behavioral principles. To build on such principles and develop new insights, either lab /field-experiment setting or observational data would be used, together with core technical foundations like applied econometrics and advanced data analysis including unstructured ones. 

The research that interests me most leverages data to explore consumers and their content-generating behavior under different environmental and marketing stimulus, especially in the digital world. Based on my own experience, I'm also devoted to help medical fundraisers in need by either platform design or social networks via medical crowfunding platform.

I have gained valuable managerial experience during my academic services providing for both [WaterDrop](https://www.waterdrop-inc.com) (2023.1-present) and [iQIYI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQIYI) (2023.6-2023.8). These opportunities allowed me to become familiar with effective management practices and develop meaningful, market-relevant research ideas.

I'm fortunate to be advised by Professor [Qiaowei Shen](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=qshen) ,  [Yingjie Zhang](https://sites.google.com/view/yingjiezhang/home) and [Hongju Liu](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=hliu) at Guanghua School of Managment. Prior to GSM, I graduated from [Central University of Finance and Economics](http://bs.cufe.edu.cn/index.htm) with a B.A. in Management. And I'm currently at Marketing Department of [Leonard N. Stern School of Business of New York University](https://www.stern.nyu.edu) as a Ph.D. Visiting Scholar supervised by [Xiao Liu](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/xiao-liu) for the 2023~2024 academic year.
