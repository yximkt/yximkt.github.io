<p><h4>Machine Learning and Social Science Research(TA)</h4>
Spring 2022 (Ph.D., Prof. <a href= "https://sites.google.com/view/yingjiezhang/home">Yingjie Zhang</a>)<br>

<small>Introduction: This is a tentative new seminar course for Ph.D. students at GSM, with Prof. <a href= "https://sites.google.com/view/yingjiezhang/home">Zhang</a> giving lectures about some basic ML algorithms and leading discussions about how we can combine ML techniques into social science especially research in the field of management or economics. I designed a NLP project as the homework for this course. Hopefully, I can design a CV project next year as the course project.</small>

<p><h4>Marketing Model I (TA)</h4>
Spring 2022 (Ph.D., Prof. <a href= "https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=xingli">Xing Li</a>)<br>

<small>Introduction: Collaborating with <a href = "https://siyiyu.com">Siyi Yu</a>, we designed some problem sets for this course, which cover basic econometrics and its applications in quantitative marketing. We might provide the problem sets and their solutions later on this web page. Stay tuned!</small>
